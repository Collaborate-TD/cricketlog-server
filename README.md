## 🎯 Background & Objectives

Traditional cricket coaching relies heavily on verbal feedback and manual observation. This project was designed to:

- Digitize critical performance moments for analysis  
- Facilitate structured, player-specific feedback  
- Enhance learning through visual cues and recorded insights  
- Build a long-term, trackable coaching relationship

---

## 🎯 Project Scope

This application represents Phase 1 of the Cricket Coach App.  
Its current focus includes:

- Manual session recording and annotation  
- Feedback delivery via text, audio, and drills  
- Role-based access and session tracking

🔒 Not included in this phase:
- AI-based tagging or drill recommendation  
- Real-time motion detection or auto-feedback  
- Cloud-based media processing

These features are intended for future enhancement (Phase 2).
